# Xamarin.Forms.Social
Attempt to create a cross platform plugin for Xamarin Forms using the native SDKs for Facebook, Google and Twitter. The Solution is set up with a .Net Standard 2.0 Library for the Shared Project.

The idea is that it uses the minimum for anyone using Forms and adapt as needed.

- Facebook:
Login works on both platforms.
TODO: delegate facebook's calls as much as possible to the shared project, add sharing and other custom Graph calls.

- Google:
TODO: everything

- Twitter:
TODO: everything

This document will be updated periodically as new features are added.
